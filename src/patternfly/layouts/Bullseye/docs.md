## Overview

Only if needed write a short description with implementation notes. Design and interaction notes are already written on the design specs, don't repeat information.

For example for buttons: Always add a modifier class to add color to the button. Never use the class `.btn` on its own.

## Accessibility

Write accessibility, aria tags, tab index and other notes to make this component accessible.
